## SQL Analysis
The SQL workflow includes:
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling null values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of churn vs non-churn  
   - Segmentation by demographics & behavior  
3. **Churn Analysis Queries**  
   - Churn rate by City Tier, Payment Mode, Device, and Order Category  
   - Impact of complaints, cashback, and satisfaction on churn  
   - Identification of high-risk customer groups
